# Clicky-Game

## What is this?
Clicky Game is a simple memory game where the user is presented with different images. The objective of the game is to click on all the images only once. If an image is clicked twice, the game resets. 

## About
Clicky Game is built on React JS with Express and Boostrap. 
This application rendes different images from a json file to the screen. 
It also keeps track of the user score which is incremented by 1 by clickin on a different image each time. If the user clicks on a previously clicked image, the score resets to 0 and the game starts again.
